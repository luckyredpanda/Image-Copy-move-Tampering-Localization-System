## Description

inbac is an **in**teractive **ba**tch **c**ropper made for quick cropping of images.  
I made this program because cropping thousands of images with image viewers or image manipulation programs was too slow.

## Installation

There are three ways to install this application.
The easiest option is to download the single file executable created with PyInstaller, which can be found on the releases page.
If you have python installed you can install with pip by typing

`pip install inbac`
If you want to use the current master branch you can clone the repository and run the project using poetry.

## Development Requirements
- [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry)
- tkinter

After installing above dependencies run `poetry install` in project directory to install remaining dependencies.

## Examples

`poetry run inbac /home/user/pictures/`  
Opens images in /home/user/pictures/ and saves cropped images to /home/user/pictures/crops

`poetry run inbac -a 1 1 -r 256 256 /home/user/pictures/ /home/user/crops/`  
Opens images in /home/user/pictures/ in 1:1 ratio selection mode and saves images resized to 256x256px in /home/user/crops/ 

## Usage

```
usage: inbac [-h] [-a ASPECT_RATIO ASPECT_RATIO] [-r RESIZE RESIZE]
             [-s SELECTION_BOX_COLOR] [-w WINDOW_SIZE WINDOW_SIZE]
             [-f IMAGE_FORMAT] [-q IMAGE_QUALITY]
             [input_dir] [output_dir]
